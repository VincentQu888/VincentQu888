## Hey there, I'm Vincent üëã

I am currently a high school student at Dr. G.W. Williams Secondary School in Aurora, Ontario. I am extremely passionate about, and dedicated to coding and computer science.

        String[] technologies = {"Heroku, Tailwind, MySQL, Spring Boot, Django, PyTorch"};

## About Me üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I first started off coding with <a href="https://github.com/VincentQu888/ccc-solutions">competitive programming</a>, and after a while, I eventually branched out to teaching coding and working on several projects I was interested in!

I've recently found myself interested in AI and its applications in NLP, so I've been learning about and <a href="https://github.com/VincentQu888/Snowy">applying</a> it in projects.
